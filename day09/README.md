# AoC 2020, day 9

Solution to the test file:

```
Part 1: first number which is not the sum of the previous ones: 127
Print 2: sum of min and max of the contiguous set of numbers summing to 127: 15 + 47 = **62**
```


## How it works?

We just use loops to loop over the numbers until we find the correct values.
