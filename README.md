# Advent Of Code 2020 - in Golang

So, I'm learning Go. AoC provides some fun exercises. Let's try them!

By the way it's 2023 when I'm doing that. But I've already done the 2022 edition (in C) and the 2021 edition (in (mostly) Python).

To run:

```bash
go build -o aoc2020 main.go
./aoc2020 1 day01/input_test 
```

Replace 1 by the day number you want to run, and the input file by the file you want to use.

There is README file for each day, with some explanations. But these README files have been written months after I solve the challenge, so the explanations maybe a bit vague.
