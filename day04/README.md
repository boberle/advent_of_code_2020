# AoC 2020, day 4

Solution to the test file:

```
Part 1: number of valid passports: 2
Part 2: number of strictly valid passports: 2
```

Solution to the second test file (`input_test2`):

```
Part 1: number of valid passports: 8
Part 2: number of strictly valid passports: 4
```

## How it works?

For the first part, we parse the passports data and check that all the required fields are present.

The second part follows the same logic, but we use stricter rules.
