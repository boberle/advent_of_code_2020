# AoC 2020, day 1

Solution to the test file:

```
PART 1: The integers are: 1721 and 299 (= 2020). Their multiplication is 514579.
PART 2: The integers are: 979, 366 and 675 (= 2020). Their multiplication is 241861950.
```

How it works?

We brute force by testing every combination of 2 (then 3) integers, using loops.
